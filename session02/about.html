        <h3>ABOUT</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Shiitake mushrooms have a rich, earthy flavor and a distinctive
                taste best described as meaty. These mushrooms have large caps
                measuring 2 to 5 inches wide, and they vary in color from light
                to chocolate brown, providing an attractive contrast with their
                pale cream underside. (Source: <a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-shiitake-mushrooms"

                —Today, shiitake mushrooms are popular around the world for
                their taste and their handy ability to grow on either natural
                fallen logs or artificial substrate. You can find them grown
                commercially in China, Japan, the United States, Korea, and
                Brazil, with China producing about 80 to 90 percent of all
                shiitake worldwide. (Source: <a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-shiitake-mushrooms"

        <h3>HEALTH BENEFITS</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Shiitake mushrooms have one of the highest amounts of natural copper, a mineral that supports healthy
                blood
                vessels, bones, and immune support. In fact, 1/2 cup of shiitake mushrooms gives you 72 percent of your
                daily recommended intake (DRI) of this mineral. The mushrooms are also a rich source of selenium,
                providing
                33 percent of your DRI. (Source: <a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-shiitake-mushrooms"
